## Book Store Inventory Oversight

### Question of Concern
The concept of this project is to determine if the bookstore company in Calgary is running into stockouts in a positive or negative way. It costs money to move inventory between the warehouse and the in person locations. 

This problem matters due to overspending on shipping of inventory to a store just to sit on a shelf where as that store location may not get enough traffic to match the inventory that have.
